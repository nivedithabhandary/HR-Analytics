# HR-Analytics
## Goal: 
* Why are company's best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely? 
* Try to predict which valuable employee will leave next. 
* Build a system which may assist in staff retention

## Dataset:
The HR analytics dataset is obtained from Kaggle Human Resources Analytics dataset.

It shows details for last 5 years and contains the following fields:
    * Employee satisfaction level, (range 0 to 1)
    * Last evaluation, (range 0 to 1)
    * Number of projects
    * Average monthly, (in hours)
    * Time spent at the company, (in years)
    * Number of work accident
    * Promotions in the last 5 years
    * Sales (or job function)
    * Salary (low, medium or high)
    * Whether the employee has left the company or not

## Analyse dataset:

The correlation between different features of the dataset showed that employees with low satisfaction_level left. The correlation heat map is shown below:

## Regression to predict satisfaction_level
To retain an employee, their satisfaction_level needs to be increased. number_project, last_evaluation and time_spend_company are the top three factors contributing to high satisfaction level amongst employees.

Random Forest Regression model was used to predict the satisfaction_level given other features. 

## Give actionable suggestions to HR
New random samples are generated by changing salary and number_projects of employees. The satisfaction_level of these samples are found and used to give actionable suggestions to HR. 
A python flask application is created for better user interaction with the system. A screenshot of the application is shown below:
